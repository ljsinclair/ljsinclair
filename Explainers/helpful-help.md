An old boss of mine once went on a rant about *helpful help*. At the time he couldn't actually explain what he meant.

## The problem with a lot of help

The problem with a lot of help is it's written from the application point of view. This assumes a number of things of the user:

* They know the application-specific names for things they want to do
* They know the order to perform the application-specific things to achieve their goal
* They know what they need before starting a particular workflow within the user interface (and can keep track of it)

## What's helpful help?

Task-based help on the other hand is written from the point of view of someone trying to achieve a specific goal.

This means the user:

* Can go straight to a specific place to find the workflow
* Can trust the workflow is complete and includes everything they need to complete said task
* Doesn't need to hunt around for information

## Example

Here's a simple non-tech comparison:

| Application help | Task help |
|---|---|
| * Turning on the kettle | * How do I boil water? |
| * Filling kettle with water |
| * Seating kettle correctly |
