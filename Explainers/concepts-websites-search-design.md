This is a basic explanation of how websites, search and design decisions work together on the World Wide Web.

## Search engines

Search engines have turned the web into a popularity contest, a competition for:

* Your time
* Your money

However, some websites also seek to exploit:

* Your data
* Your identity

## How do sites compete for resources?

There are three ways a website competes for resources:

* SEO is the "legal" way of competing for resources
* Marketing methods are a way to encourage a visitor to hand over their resources
* Deceptive design is a manipulative way of obtaining resources

### SEO

At its most basic, SEO is a way of using search terms (keywords) an individual associates with a particular thing.

The more search terms are included in your website content, the higher its chance of appearing in search results, preferably on the first page of any given search engine.

Of course, it's a lot more complicated than that.

### Marketing methods

Marketing uses psychological methods to encourage a visitor to stay on the site, such as:

* Delayed gratification -- e.g., when a web page has a lot of filler text before getting to the point
* Fear -- suggesting a visitor will be worse off if they leave
* Shortage -- implying a visitor will miss out on benefits if they don't stay

The objectives include:
* serving advertising content which only pays the site owner if it's displayed
* improving SEO statistics, because these are also governed by the time spent on a website
* encouraging the visitor to sign up, buy something or create an account.

### Deceptive design (AKA "Dark Patterns")

Deceptive design, also known as "Dark patterns" are a way of manipulating a website visitor, such as:

* collecting and retaining personal data without consent
* making it difficult to close accounts
* endless scroll with randomly inserted "popular" items
* popup messages to distract a visitor's attention
* putting pressure on a visitor to perform a particular action
