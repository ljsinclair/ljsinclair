## You're Not Going Anywhere
**Brisbane Airport, Brisbane**

*You're Not Going Anywhere*


compels the audience to participate in the performance by marooning them without hope in Brisbane Airport. Only then can we truly experience the Boschian horrors on offer.

Oh, and I can confirm Brisbane airport is a sub-optimal place to spend the night. Ask me how I know.
Then soent another hour wauting for tyem to arrange accommodation before being told at around 0145 that there was literally no more rooms available anywhere in brisbane, the upper level was clising and we were on our own. But checkin opened in 3 hours so that was ok.
Yep. Brisbane airport has seating of heironymous boschian horror. Weird geometric arm rests to orevent any chance of (a) lying down or (b) having anything but a neck injury if seated upright
i realised afterwards that virgin has a perfectly well appointed "club lounge" with the comfy chairs wide enough to sit down without your nice fat wallet digging into your leg. But these delights were iff limits.
If I'd been (a) aware of it and (b) remotely able to speak without slurring my words, i would have. As it was i was running on fumes
At least once I edit out the swearing, and pull back from swraring protracted vengeance against the airline because tgat sort of thing doesn't go down well
No point discovering the hard way that the melbourne remand centre has zero stars on tripadvisor
Yeah, maybe they've hosed the vom off the walls and hung a cardboard air freshener off a light fitting?
The smell of artificial pine created by someone who's never even seen one
