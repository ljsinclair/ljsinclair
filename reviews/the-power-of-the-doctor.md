# Leaning out on Diversity
## My analysis of the last 10 seconds of The Power of The Doctor

## Before you read on

* **SPOILER ALERT** Read **no** further if you haven't watched  [The Power of The Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_the_Doctor)
* [Learn about Regeneration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(Doctor_Who))


> And just so you know, my opinions here are directed squarely at the BBC and showrunner Russell T. Davies. David Tennant has every right to accept roles he wants to take, especially one he clearly loves so much.

## The 13th Doctor's story has concluded

Jody Whittaker's run as the 13th Doctor hasn't been easy, and like the first of **anyone** in a role, she's been subject to criticism not experienced by other actors who played The Doctor save for Colin Baker's experiences in the 1980s[^b3d5]. And thanks to Covid-19, she also experienced the first truncated season since 1986[^7abf].

Her final episode, The Power of The Doctor was a rollercoaster of emotion, funny, exciting, scary and at the end I was genuinely sad to see her leave the role.

And then this happened:

## What's wrong with this picture?

From a purely observational standpoint, here's the situation as I see it.

* [Jody finished filming her run back in 2021](https://collider.com/doctor-who-jodie-whittaker-regeneration-scene-comments/).
* This was the close of her era and she didn't hand-over to a new Doctor at the time because one hadn't been chosen.
* [Ncuti Gatwa was announced in May 2022 as the next actor to play the coveted role](https://www.doctorwho.tv/news-and-features/ncuti-gatwa-is-the-doctor) by returning showrunner Russell T. Davies[^afd3].
* After leaving the show in 2010, [David Tennant and Catherine Tate will be returning in 2023 for three specials to celebrate the show's 60th anniversary](https://www.doctorwho.tv/news-and-features/david-tennant-catherine-tate-return).
* And at the conclusion of The Power of The Doctor, Jody's 13th Doctor regenerated into... David Tennant?!

**What**, indeed.

### Good intentions and the road to hell

I expect that on paper, the idea to have David Tennant return to the role of The Doctor after 12 years absence would have looked like it was made of **SOLID WIN!!**[^t5yh]. I mean, there he is, he loves the role and his era is held to be a high-point in the same way as Tom Baker's was from the perspective of the 1980s.

Had Tennant returned as the [10th Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_Doctor), I'd be all in. It's really cool to "discover" episodes of a show's run you've never seen (and I get that in this case, they're brand new episodes).

Except [David Tennant is the 14th Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Doctor), which means he's now had **three** cracks at the role[^7d7e].

And the fact this occurred during the UK's [Black History Month](https://www.blackhistorymonth.org.uk/article/section/news/black-history-month-resource-pack-2022/) makes the decision a real head-scratcher.

That's because [Ncugi Gatwa is, in fact, a Black man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncuti_Gatwa)[^e0f8].

## Load the canon!

It's said that what's transmitted is canon, the fact of the show, and can't be undone. This means we must respect the premise offered at the conclusion of The Power of The Doctor[^13ed].

Within the narrative we can hypothesise the 14th Doctor has the face of the 10th because of the Master's meddling in The Power of The Doctor. Call it a **Reversion** rather than a **Regeneration** if you like.

But rather than give the job to someone who's already had a full run of 3 seasons, a full year of specials **and** appeared in the 50th anniversary special [The Day of The Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_of_the_Doctor), why not appoint someone whose tenure has been patchy at best, for instance:
* [Paul McGann's 8th Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Doctor) who got a backdoor pilot back in the 1990s, then a ten minute short during the 50th Anniversary; OR
* [Jo Martin's Fugitive Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_Doctor) who has appeared in one full episode and had cameos in three subsequent episodes since then.

Hell, the showrunners don't even have to look very far because they *both* appeared in The Power of The Doctor!

### But he's a fan favourite!

Yeah, and so are [all the other actors to play the part](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doctor_(Doctor_Who)), so let's not get carried away here.

## The dastardly plan to erase the Doctor

Jody Whittaker's final adventure involves a complex storyline, which includes attempts by her nemesis [The Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_(Doctor_Who)) played by Sacha Dhawan to erase all incarnations of The Doctor from existence.

His hate isn't new[^09e7], and in this case is the result of discoveries revealed in [Spyfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyfall_(Doctor_Who)) then in [The Timeless Children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Timeless_Children).

### Splitting quantum hairs?

As part of The Master's dastardly plot, he forces the 13th Doctor to regenerate not only with his appearance but his memories. For a while it looks like The Doctor is dead.

Importantly, The Master ends up wearing the 13th Doctor's outfit, plus the dangly earring which came in handy during [The Legend of the Sea Devils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_the_Sea_Devils).

But then we get to the regeneration scene right at the end of the episode and not only does David Tennant appear, he's wearing a [suit and overcoat, that looks a lot like his original costume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_Doctor#Appearance).

There are a whole bucket of problems with this, not least of which is that it breaks the very continuity that the trolls have been screaming about since 2017.

## Don't feed the trolls

> Once upon a time, there was an angry mob of Tiki-torch wielding trolls threatening to burn your hovel down. They're protesting because you've hired Cinderella and they say she doesn't sweep the dirt nearly as well as your previous 12 employees.

And back to reality, we've got something similar going on with a toxic subset of Doctor Who fandom whose members have been screaming like cut pigs ever since [Jodie Whittaker got the role back in 2017](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/07/doctor-who-jodie-whittaker-13th-doctor/). Here's a small sample:

* [The drinker on the 13th Doctor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGWxjHBSn-4)[^29dd]
* [Not the doctor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82d5SrsPkIg)
* [The fall of Doctor Who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8_A7n83Rh0)

...and it's not hard to find more.

### The Continuity is more like *guidelines*...[^4e28]

It's an established fact in the Doctor Who continuity that Time Lords regenerate their **bodies**, not their clothes[^9ub5].

But "Fuck continuity," say the trolls, because [Space Jesus is back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQbaCs4PvF4) to vanquish the [Woke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke) brigade, smite the [Social Justice Warriors](https://fee.org/articles/how-the-term-social-justice-warrior-became-an-insult/) and restore the show to its former glories! **Hallelujah!!**. And best of all, there's not a trace of the 13th Doctor, not even her clothing[^dcaa].

Or in other words, the regeneration scene **vindicates** the opinions of the very toxic fandom that has plagued the entire run of Jody Whittaker's Doctor.

And to add insult to injury, by re-establishing the character's dominant, traditional appearance, the showrunners have prevented another first for the show: the first female Doctor regenerating into the first Black male Doctor.

> Thankfully, Cinders' contract is up, so you've hired a former employee in the hope the mob will be appeased. That'll give you a year to prepare, because the trolls will go ballistic when they see the next guy...

## Leaning OUT on Diversity

In the opinion of this humble scribbler, the world established by [Verity Lambert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verity_Lambert) and [Waris Hussein](https://www.doctorwho.tv/news-and-features/doctor-whos-first-director-the-doctor-solves-peoples-loneliness) back in 1963 deserves better than fans who aggressively pursue a view of racial and sexual purity and refuse to let anyone else play in the universe of Doctor Who.

And by delaying Ncuti Gatwa's appointment as the **next** Doctor as announced in May 2022, the BBC and showrunners have missed a golden opportunity to **lean-in on diversity** during Black History Month, and continue to reflect the variety of faces, genders and genetics we see in the society of the third decade of the 21st century.


[^b3d5]: Believe me when I say, every actor gets bad scripts from time to time. For every [Orphan 55](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan_55) there is a [Love and Monsters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_%26_Monsters), a [Planet of the Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_of_the_Dead), an [End of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_Time_(Doctor_Who)), a [Kill the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_the_Moon), [Sleep No More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_No_More_(Doctor_Who)) and a [The Lie of the Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lie_of_the_Land).

[^7abf]: FYI, [Shada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shada_(Doctor_Who)) was abandoned due to industrial action in 1980, and [Colin Baker's final season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(season_23)) was truncated through BBC interference. Jody Whittaker's [Season 13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(series_13)) was severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and health directives from the government and health services.

[^afd3]: I found this utterly bizarre at the time. Surely there is another showrunner in the entire UK that could do the job rather than the Back To The Future return of RTD?

[^t5yh]: A bit like [the finale of Battlestar Galactica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daybreak_(Battlestar_Galactica)) or [Prometheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus_(2012_film)) to name but two.

[^7d7e]: Don't believe me? Go back and watch Christopher Eccleston's swansong, [Journey's End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey%27s_End_(Doctor_Who)) which results in David Tennant's 10th Doctor, [The Parting of the Ways, season 1, ep 13](https://thetvdb.com/series/doctor-who-2005/episodes/371448) where the 10th Doctor not only regenerates without changing his face but gets a twin onto the bargain, and now The Power of The Doctor where we get a 14th Doctor with a strangely familiar face.

[^e0f8]: Barbara Blake-Hannah suggests we use a capital "B" when referring to Black people in this article: [My Black skin got me sacked from British TV. That’s why I spend my life fighting racism](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/27/black-skin-sacked-british-tv-racism)

[^13ed]: If wishes were horses as they say, especially regarding the past 5 years of online hate from alleged fans.

[^09e7]: The Master has taken pot-shots at The Doctor before, just watch [Logopolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logopolis) or [Castrovalva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castrovalva_(Doctor_Who)) from 1981 if you don't believe me.

[^29dd]: And Pro-Tip to The Drinker if you're reading: stating an opinion is fine; misrepresentations are not. It took me five minutes to find online articles that refute every single accusation you made against Jody Whittaker and Chris Chibnall from the 4:25 mark. You should try it some time.

[^4e28]: [The pirate's code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omjnIeLIzJc)

[^9ub5]: Zygons are the ones who can do clothes as demonstrated in [The Day of The Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_of_the_Doctor)

[^dcaa]: Because it'd be **ewww** if The Doctor ended up wearing **women's clothing**!
