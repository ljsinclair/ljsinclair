# I'm LJ Sinclair, and I'm a writer

That sounds like the opening spiel to an addiction confession, doesn't it? And in my case, there's some truth to that. I get quite twitchy if I go too long between arranging words in a pleasing order. And there's no twelve-step programme for this kind of addiction, let me tell you.

## The right word, in the right place, at the right time

Anyone can type words into a word processor, email or social media with mixed results.

But to communicate meaning without ambiguity, you need someone who knows how to:

* establish the facts through direct research and working with subject matter experts
* determine the audience
* turn complex, ambiguous ideas into clear, easy to understand content
* and do all this without leaning into the tropes of marketing, hard sell or manipulation

To paraphrase  [Charlie Taub (Vadim Glowna)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadim_Glowna) in the [Jack Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Irish) movies:

> Technical Communication is to Writing what Software Engineering is to Programming.

## But why isn't it pretty?

Simple really: I'm a writer not a designer.

I'd rather leave design to the professionals and concentrate on what I'm good at.

And the benefit to you is you can see the writing for what it is, not get distracted by pretty designs, flashy graphics, colours and JavaScript jiggery-pokery.

But yes, I have built websites using HTML and CSS, Content Management Systems (CMS) like WordPress and Confluence, and the Jekyll and Zola site builders.
