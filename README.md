# I'm LJ Sinclair, and I'm a writer

Sounds like the opening spiel to an addiction confession, doesn't it? And in my case, there's some truth to that. I get quite twitchy if I go too long between arranging words in a pleasing order. And there's no twelve-step programme for this kind of addiction, let me tell you.

## The right word, in the right place, at the right time

That's the one-line summary for marketing purposes, which will allegedly make people's eyes light up and their wallets open.

Now, anyone can choose their words and type them in a word processor or in an email or on Twitter or Facebook. And I'd say this is the reason the world is in such a mess right now.

A qualified and experienced writer can help you avoid the pitfalls of communication, so you can clearly communicate in a respectful and engaging manner (and by *engaging* I don't mean ALL CAPS, FLASHING IMAGES or impossible to avoid popups).

## But why isn't it pretty?

Simple really: I've decided to host the whole thing with GitHub.

But deeper than that, I'm a writer not a designer.

I've built sites with straight HTML/CSS, PHP, Wordpress, Jekyll and Zola. And in the majority of cases, I spend more time trying to hack the themes to do something useful than doing what I'm good at.

I'd rather leave design to the professionals and concentrate what I'm good at.

And there's a hidden benefit to you, dear visitor: you can see the writing for what it is, not distracted by flashy graphics, colours and javascript jiggery-pokery.

But if you want a designer, I can definitely recommend [Manita Johnson](http://manita.com.au/)
