### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm LJ Sinclair and I'm a writer. I also dabble in web design, not the coding, but putting sites up and adding content.

I've started the **[Remember Me](https://github.com/ljsinclair/remember)** wiki to drop useful fixes, information and workarounds I've discovered over the years.

## Currently working on

* Chapter 21 of The Book
* Remember Me wiki
* A second cup of chai

### Past projects

Some projects I've worked on recently:

* [mamori.io docs](https://doc.mamori.io)
* [uEducateUs website](https://ueducateus.com.au)
