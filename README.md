# I'm LJ Sinclair, and I'm a writer

Sounds like the opening spiel to an addiction confession, doesn't it? And in my case, there's some truth to that. I get quite twitchy if I go too long between arranging words in a pleasing order. And there's no twelve-step programme for this kind of addiction, let me tell you.

## The right word, in the right place, at the right time

That's the one-line summary for marketing purposes, which will allegedly make people's eyes light up and their wallets open.

Now, anyone can choose their words and type them in a word processor or in an email or on Twitter or Facebook. And I'd say this is the reason the world is in such a mess right now.

If you want to clearly communicate your intentions, information in a respectful and engaging manner[^1] you need a writer. It doesn't have to be me, but it **does** need to be someone who knows how to determine answers to these questions:
* Who -- who are you and who's the audience?
* What -- what do you want to communicate?
* Why -- why do you want to communicate this message, why now, why the tools, medium and other details.
* When -- when do you want people to know?
* Where -- where's the writing going to go?
* How -- how do you want it communicated (email, twitter, carrier pigeon, etc)

Some people call this *the brief*, others *the specification* but it's worth doing. Planning is not a joke; you'll save time, money and perhaps your reputation if you stop and think things through.

Just saying.
