# I'm LJ Sinclair, and I'm a writer

Sounds like the opening spiel to an addiction confession, doesn't it? And in my case, there's some truth to that. I get quite twitchy if I go too long between arranging words in a pleasing order. And there's no twelve-step programme for this kind of addiction, let me tell you.

## The right word, in the right place, at the right time

That's the one-line summary for marketing purposes, which will allegedly make people's eyes light up and their wallets open.

Now, anyone can choose their words and type them in a word processor or in an email or on Twitter or Facebook. And I'd say this is the reason the world is in such a mess right now.

A qualified and experienced writer can help you avoid the pitfalls of communication, so you can clearly communicate in a respectful and engaging manner (and by *engaging* I don't mean ALL CAPS, FLASHING IMAGES or impossible to avoid popups). 

You don't have to choose me, but whoever you do choose, you'll need answers to these basic questions:

* Who -- who are you and who's the audience?
* What -- what do you want to communicate?
* Why -- why do you want to communicate this message, why now, why the tools, medium and other details.
* When -- when do you want people to know?
* Where -- where's the writing going to go?
* How -- how do you want it communicated (email, twitter, carrier pigeon, etc)

Some people call this *the brief*, others *the specification* but it's worth doing. 

Bottom line: Planning is not a joke; you'll save time, money and perhaps your reputation if you stop and think things through. Or you can throw your opinion onto Twitter and watch your life disintegrate.

Up to you, really.
