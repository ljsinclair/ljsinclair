### Hi there 👋

I'm LJ Sinclair and I'm a writer. I also dabble in web design, not the coding, but putting sites up and adding content. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ... my first book "The Immortality Machine" which after 10 years work is finally reaching its conclusion.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... about GitHub pages, different static site builders and the mind-numbing bureaucracy of the Australian Home Affairs Department.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ... Writing projects
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with ... The environment, political ineptitude, human stupidity.
- 💬 Ask me about ... Writing. You know you want to. It's the one thing that tends to get overlooked until the wheels fall off and it's suddenly The Most Important Thing In Da World.
- 📫 How to reach me: ... projects@ljsinclair.net
- 😄 Pronouns: ... She/They/Them/Hey you!
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I've written at leat 4 complete novels over the past 10 years and my friends just laugh when I say "I've finished" because I always go again. But this time I'll show them!
