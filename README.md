# I'm LJ Sinclair, and I'm a writer

## The right word, in the right place, at the right time

Anyone can type words into a word processor, email or social media with mixed results.

But to communicate meaning without ambiguity, you need someone who knows how to:

* establish the facts through direct research and working with subject matter experts
* determine the audience
* turn complex, ambiguous ideas into clear, easy to understand content
* and do all this without leaning into the tropes of marketing, hard sell or manipulation

To paraphrase  [Charlie Taub (Vadim Glowna)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadim_Glowna) in the [Jack Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Irish) movies:

> Technical Communication is to Writing what Software Engineering is to Programming.

## But why isn't it pretty?

A lot of websites are like those blockbuster movies where the story and plot **serve** the flashy Special Effects (SFX).

But from a writing point of view, this approach puts aesthetics before function.

It's for that reason I've decided on GitHub to host my content which means the content can stand on its own.

Not to mention, I can write it in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), which is plain text and can be exported (using tools such as [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)) to different file formats.
