# I'm LJ Sinclair, and I'm a writer

That sounds like the opening spiel to an addiction confession, doesn't it? And in my case, there's some truth to that. I get quite twitchy if I go too long between arranging words in a pleasing order. And there's no twelve-step programme for this kind of addiction, let me tell you.

## The right word, in the right place, at the right time

Anyone can type words into a word processor, email or social media with mixed results.

But to communicate meaning without ambiguity, you need someone who knows how to:

* establish the facts through direct research and working with subject matter experts
* determine the audience
* turn complex, ambiguous ideas into clear, easy to understand content
* and do all this without leaning into the tropes of marketing, hard sell or manipulation

To paraphrase  [Charlie Taub (Vadim Glowna)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadim_Glowna) in the [Jack Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Irish) movies:

> Technical Communication is to Writing what Software Engineering is to Programming.

## But why isn't it pretty?

A good User Experience (UX) is one where the audience gets the information they need when they need it.

That's why I chose GitHub for a homepage, because it's clean and minimalistic (not to mention I can write content in Markdown).

That isn't to say I don't appreciate good design that:

* prioritises usability and accessibility for the audience
* helps the audience find what they need as quickly and efficiently as possible
* is tested to verify these are the case.

But it's far too easy to find sites and software that:

* [deceive the audience](https://www.deceptive.design/)
* [put design decisions before UX](https://grumpy.website/)
