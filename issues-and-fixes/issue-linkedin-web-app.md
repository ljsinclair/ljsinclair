## Issue

LinkedIn web app has two problems:

* keeps popping up "use our app for a better experience"
* doesn't have a logout button

## Environment

* Android
* Brave browser

## Cause

Looks a lot like a dark pattern to me, where websites are designed to be difficult to use under certain circumstances to either:
* manipulate and/or force the visitor to do something the vendor wants
* prevent a visitor using the system

In this case it appears this is a combination of both.

## Workaround

* Short-term - I cleared the cache and deleted all cookies, then restarted the browser.
* Long term - Don't visit LinkedIn in the web browser. And my personal preference is not to install the Android app because I don't like being manipulated.
