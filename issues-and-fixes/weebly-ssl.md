## Issue

This is a subset of Weebly setup

SSL instructions say to click "settings" but this doesn't work if you're in the account system.
## Cause

Documentation across the board mixes instructional content with procedural.

In this case, the instruction where to find these settings is buried at the end of the first paragraph.

## Solution

The SSL is accessible from the Site Editor system.

NOTE: Site SSL cannot be setup unless custom domain is successfully connected to Weebly system.

1. Login to Weebly
2. Click **Edit** on the homepage to edit the site
3. Click **Settings** to open site settings
4. Setup your SSL certificate
