I've written these two strategies to start to quantify and explain how to write tech docs.

## The six basic questions

One strategy I use is to keep in mind six basic questions:

* Who is it for?
* What's the purpose, benefits and costs?
* When and where should this be attempted (or not attempted)?
* Why is this the best approach (and are there any alternatives)?
* How does the user perform the task?

## Structure and hierarchy

A second strategy is to approach documentation in a similar way to software development. To this end, I work to make sure articles are:

* focused on a single context and task
* modular and reusable to avoid duplication and use in different contexts
* hierarchical, so overview material is kept separate from detailed tasks
