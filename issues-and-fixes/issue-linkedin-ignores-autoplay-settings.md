## Issue

LinkedIn, does not respect browser "Do Not Autoplay Video" settings.

Message from LinkedIn:

> Note: We recommend disabling video player-related browser extensions while on LinkedIn, since these may interfere with Autoplay functionality.

## Cause

For some bizarre reason, LinkedIn sees fit to ignore browser settings and instead has their own settings to handle video Autoplay.

Is this a [Dark Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern)? You betcha!

## Solution (as of 2021-02-04)

* Login to LinkedIn
* Click your personal icon in the top toolbar > Settings & Privacy > Account Preferences.
* Click Autoplay Videos > wait for it to expand...
* Toggle to **NO**.
