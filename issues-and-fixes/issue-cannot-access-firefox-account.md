## Issue

Login to Firefox account fails after entering verification code with error “You must use your primary email”

## Cause

Possibly caching issue, but to date, I'm not convinced.

## Solution

1. In your browser, visit <a href="https://accounts.firefox.com/clear" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">https://accounts.firefox.com/clear</a>
2.  Attempt login again.
