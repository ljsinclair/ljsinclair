## Solutions and rules

1. If I can't see it, it doesn't exist
2. Put things where I need to use them (e.g., food by cooker, benches, etc)
3. Use boxes to store similar stuff
  * I use wine boxes but you can use anything
  * LABEL them, don't just leave them as-is
4. IKEA cube storage is really useful, especially by the front door
  * box for shoes
  * box for vacuum cleaner (I've got a Dyson hand-held)
  * box for the go-bag -- a divided backpack works best for me. Sacks with straps are useless.
  * box for go-pouches
5. Prepare a go-bag with specific things I **always need** when going out, for example:
  * Asthma inhaler
  * face masks
  * waterproof jacket (it's a bright yellow, lightweight bike jacket)
  * shopping bag
  * spare transport card
  * Go-pouches go into the bag when I'm off out to do specific things
6. Prepare go-pouches to go into the Go-bag to perform specifics, such as:
  * photography - bag with camera, lens brush, charger, cables
  * laptop (surface pro in this case) with cables, keyboard, power supply, etc
7. Blackboards are useful for reminders
  * I have a school-sized blackboard which has daily stuff
  * I've also painted the refrigerator doors with blackboard paint so I can add things for shopping
8. Online shopping
  * Rather than wandering around a supermarket trying to find what I'm looking for, I use online shopping.
  * It's faster because I can search on stuff I need
  * It's simpler because I can pay $10 and get home delivery which saves a lot of time
9. Daily list
  * Write a daily list each morning at breakfast, and write down the things done to that point (e.g., shower, meds, write list) plus things to do during the day
10. Technology is not always better
  * Sometimes technology is amazeballs, and sometimes it's an impediment to getting things done.
  * Rule of thumb: if the app/software takes longer to setup and learn than writing something down on paper, the paper wins.
  * Sometimes it's simpler to just use a calendar
11. email is a bucket to throw things into.
  * I've setup folders for specific purposes so I know the status of emails at a given moment (modelled on Kanban columns)
  * To-do is for stuff I haven't done yet
  * In progress is stuff that's incomplete but being done
  * Complete is stuff that's done
  * Nope is stuff I'm not doing
  * On hold is stuff that's been started but needs a larger amount of time than currently available
  * Keep is for stuff that's important to keep a track of long-term
