## Issue

I get really lost when messages get forwarded all over the place, responses pile up and there are multiple addresses to deal with.
In addition, I have ADHD which makes clutter and disorganization really problematic.

## Cause

* Email sucks
* message threads get too complex
* multiple questions are answered in the same thread, leading to confusion as to what's been done, when and all the rest of it
* finding information in email threads is a nightmare.

## My solution

### Conservation of energy solution
(i.e., this is the fastest way to solve the issue)

1. Create folders in email system
* Todo
* In progress
* On hold
* Rejected
* Complete

2. Redirect all incoming mail to /todo folder

Processing mail then becomes a case of drag and drop.

### Investigation of other ways to do this

* Seek out a "Kanban-style" email client.

There are a few systems that could handle email in this way:
* trouble ticketing systems
* third party providers to process email into Kanban columns
However, these all have considerable overhead to setup, maintain and some cost money.
And as for someone else handling email, well that's a recipe for OpSec disaster.

**Conclusion**: Kanban email isn't really a thing, or at least, 9/10ths of clients can't handle it. There's occasional blog posts and attempts to make this a thing but there's zero traction at time of writing.
