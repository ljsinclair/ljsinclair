## Issue

Brave Browser (v1.41.100) always prompts to save personal data, including:

* passwords
* physical addresses
* payment methods

Also, there's no settings for this in the Brave browser settings window under Privacy & security.

## Cause

From an engineering point of view, the settings are part of the autofill system, for which there **are** settings.

However, from a UX point of view, they should be under Privacy & Security.

## Solution

1. Open 3 bar menu > Settings (4th from bottom)
2. Scroll to Autofill.
3. Click and disable each setting as required:
* Passwords
* Payment methods
* Addresses and more
