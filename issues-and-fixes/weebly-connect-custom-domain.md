## Issue

Connecting a custom domain is over-complicated and it's hard to work out the actual setup steps to connect a domain to Weebly.

## Cause

First up, the UX is confusing:
* You can connect domains from the account settings
* You can add a site address from the site editor
* The UI actively hides settings after setup
* The help pages mix explanations and procedural material

Second, the Domains page says "DOMAINNAMEwas successfully connected. It can take 24 hours for changes to appear across all browsers."

Except, the third party domain status says "Not connected".

## This issue is unresolved

Important: Record the settings when adding a custom domain and keep them safe somewhere useful.
