# Leaning out on Diversity
## My analysis of the last 10 seconds of a TV show I love

**SPOILER ALERT** Read **no** further if you haven't watched  [The Power of The Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_the_Doctor)

Jody Whittaker's run as the 13th Doctor hasn't been easy, and like the first of **anyone** in a role, she's been subject to criticism -- and believe me when I say, every actor gets bad scripts from time to time[^b3d5] -- not experienced by other actors who played The Doctor save for Colin Baker's experiences in the 1980s. Not only that, she experienced the first truncated season since Colin's run, too[^7abf]. 

Her final episode, The Power of The Doctor was a rollercoaster of emotion, funny, exciting, scary and at the end I was genuinely sad to see her leave the role.

And then this happened:

## Awesome! David Tennant is back!

It's been known for a while that [David Tennant and Catherine Tate would be returning for three specials to celebrate the show's 60th anniversary](https://www.doctorwho.tv/news-and-features/david-tennant-catherine-tate-return).

And had Tennant had returned as the 10th Doctor, I'd be all in. It's really cool to "discover" episodes of a show's run you've never seen (and I get that in this case, they're brand new episodes).

Except [David Tennant is the 14th Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Doctor), which means he's now had **three** cracks at the role[^7d7e].

And just so you know, I want to make it clear that David Tennant has every right to accept roles he wants to take, especially one he clearly loves so much. My opinions here are directed squarely at the BBC and showrunner Russell T. Davies.

## He's a fan favourite!

There are a whole bucket of problems in returning **like this**, not least of which is that it breaks the very continuity that certain fans have been screaming about since Jody Whittaker took on the role of the 13th Doctor, and showrunner Chris Chibnall introduced the Timeless Child storyline back in [The Ghost Monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ghost_Monument) in 2018.

But you know what, let's not debate continuity because that's a slippery beast at the best of times, and concentrate instead on real world impacts.

## What's wrong with this picture?

From a purely observational standpoint, here's the situation as I see it.

* [Jody finished filming her run back in 2021](https://www.smh.com.au/culture/tv-and-radio/saying-goodbye-is-hard-jodie-whittaker-s-time-in-tardis-ends-20221017-p5bqd2.html).
* This was the close of her era and she didn't hand-over to a new Doctor at the time because one hadn't been chosen.
* [Ncuti Gatwa was announced in May 2022 as the next actor to play the coveted role](https://www.doctorwho.tv/news-and-features/ncuti-gatwa-is-the-doctor) by returning showrunner Russell T. Davies[^afd3].
* As mentioned, David Tennant and Catherine Tate return in 2023.
* And at the conclusion of The Power of The Doctor, we got David Tennant rather than Ncuti Gatwa.

### You be the judge

The Master's dastardly plan to **erase** The Doctor from the universe in The Power of The Doctor is an extension of this incarnation's hatred which began with [Spyfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyfall_(Doctor_Who)) then continued into [The Timeless Children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Timeless_Children). And it's not a new sentiment by the way[^09e7].

But the showrunners have gone one better and in my opinion, played right into the hands of the worst fandom can offer.

## What's a hater to think?

There's a particularly nasty section of Doctor Who fandom[^b582] who have been screaming like cut pigs ever since Jodie Whittaker got the role. For example:

* [The drinker on the 13th Doctor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGWxjHBSn-4)[^29dd]
* [Not the doctor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82d5SrsPkIg)
* [The fall of Doctor Who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8_A7n83Rh0)

...and it's not hard to find more.

And now all their dreams have come true.

If the 14th Doctor appeared in the 13th Doctor's clothing -- just like The Master did during the episode, right down to the dangly earring that came in so handy in [The Legend of the Sea Devils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_the_Sea_Devils) -- then the 14th would be the **successor** to the 13th Doctor. And this is because it's established that Time Lord **bodies** regenerate, **not** their clothes.

But here, the 13th Doctor has been swiped away, disappeared. The rules of regeneration have been discarded, and now the 10th Doctor has returned, pretty much just as he looked like when we last saw him, to presumably steady the ship and return the show to its halcyon days[^66b7].

Call me cynical, but I think this looks like a case of **appeasement** by the showrunners, and this means the poisonous fandom can feel **vindicated** because RTD and the BBC appear to have accepted their opinions regarding the 13th Doctor and Jody Whittaker.

This isn't just an act of blatant sabotage against Jody Whittaker's run as the first female Doctor in the show's history, and a betrayal of anyone who thinks other people should get a go in the role, but it's also a resounding slap in the face to the first black male actor in the role. Because by delaying Ncuti Gatwa's appointment as The Doctor, the BBC and production team have made it **abundantly clear** they'd rather re-establish the dominant, traditional appearance and gender of the Doctor as a white male, and abandon five years of work by everyone who worked on the previous seasons.

## Reversion Doctor

But let's take another view and accept the idea that the 14th Doctor has come about because of the Master's meddling in The Power of The Doctor. Call it a **Reversion** rather than a **Regeneration** if you like.

So why not give fans what they want, and give two Doctors their time in the sun, say for instance [Paul McGann's 8th Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Doctor) or [Jo Martin's Fugitive Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_Doctor)?

It's not like the showrunners would've had to look far; they both appeared in the episode!

## Leaning out on Diversity

Diversity has finally got its time in the sun and this is reflected in casting choices across the board, not just Jody Whittaker and Ncuti Gatwa. There's a long way to go of course, but at least we're seeing a better representation of the real world.

However the decisions that led to the 14th Doctor's appearance are in my opinion, a stunning missed opportunity to lean in on diversity, to let **everyone** have a Doctor that looks like them. 

We live in the third decade of the 21st century. Surely we can do better than this?

[^7d7e]: Don't believe me? Go back and watch [The Parting of the Ways, season 1, ep 13](https://thetvdb.com/series/doctor-who-2005/episodes/371448), Christopher Eccleston's swansong, [Journey's End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey%27s_End_(Doctor_Who)) and now The Power of The Doctor.

[^afd3]: I found this utterly bizarre at the time. Surely there is another showrunner in the entire UK that could do the job rather than the Back To The Future return of RTD?

[^29dd]: And Pro-Tip to The Drinker if you're reading, stating an opinion is fine. Misrepresentations are not. It took me five minutes to find online articles that refute every single accusation you made against Jody Whittaker and Chris Chibnall from the 4:25 mark. You should try it some time.

[^09e7]: The Master has taken pot-shots at The Doctor before, just watch [Logopolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logopolis) or [Castrovalva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castrovalva_(Doctor_Who)) from 1981 if you don't believe me.

[^b3d5]: Bad writing is subjective and isn't confined to one actor and production team. For every [Orphan 55](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan_55) there is a [Love and Monsters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_%26_Monsters), a [Planet of the Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_of_the_Dead), an [End of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_Time_(Doctor_Who)), a [Kill the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_the_Moon), [Sleep No More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_No_More_(Doctor_Who)) and a [The Lie of the Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lie_of_the_Land).

[^66b7]: Nostalgia is great and seeing a previous Doctor back on screen is a very enjoyable thing. But there are limits you have to establish in order to move the story and the production forward. I'd love to see more of Matt Smith's Doctor, mainly because in my head-canon, he's ADHD just like me. But it's not possible in practice, not least of which is he's an actor who's got to work.

[^7abf]: FYI, [Shada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shada_(Doctor_Who)) was abandoned due to industrial action in 1980, and [Colin Baker's final season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(season_23)) was truncated through BBC interference. Jody Whittaker's [Season 13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(series_13)) was severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and health directives from the government and health services.
