title: Managing short and long-term tasks

* [learn about kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development))

I've tried a lot of ways to manage short and long-term tasks, together with things I want to do but can't right now (for reasons), and generally keeping myself organised.
Tried and abandoned

I've tried task lists on phone and computer but these tend to fail despite the fact I'm always on computers because of my work:

* there's usually no way to add enough detail to make them meaningful
* changing order to prioritise isn't always possible
* they often don't have any reminders
* too easy to get out of hand, lose things, forget to look, etc

The same goes for calendars both physical in a diary or on the wall. Though I do add reminders in the phone calendar because they can popup reminders. That is, as long as I remember:
* to set them
* to set AM vs PM or vice-versa

## How I manage Daily/short-term tasks

I have an A4-sized notebook for daily tasks (I've tried smaller format and it doesn't work well for some reason), which includes simple things I've already done plus things I know I do need to do in the day. Hand writing the tasks seems to make them stick in my mind, so there's that.

For example, today's list has:

* sleep in
* surf (as in internet looking at sites/news, etc, not literally because I'm simply not that energetic in the morning, plus live 40+km from the nearest surf beach.)
* shower
* list
* take meds
* wash clothes
* empty dish drainer...
* ...etc

Each thing I do gets a tick against it, to give me a sense of achievement at the end of the day.

If anything's left over from the previous day, I prioritise it

* Does this thing need to be done in next 24 hours?
  * Yes - goes on the list
* Does this thing need to be done this week?
  * Yes - goes on the list
  * No - Add to the long-term list

## Breaking down a big scary task into achievable parts

I am unlikely to complete a task that's "generally" defined.

For example: "Find a job" is too big an idea.

What I need to do is break it down into smaller chunks that I can achieve; they can be performed in a specific order, or at different times.

For example, for me "get a job" involves these specific tasks:

* update resume/CV (this is the priority and nothing moves until this happens)
* update job sites -- the ones that take a copy of your resume and smoosh it into their systems, like LinkedIn [I don't like them either, but they're almost impossible to ignore]
*  Find which job "title" is best for me -- in my case, "writer" is too broad and ends up with a lot of crap, so I need to focus down to Technical Writer
* send known recruiters updated resume
* ...etc

## To the Kanban!

Get a big piece of paper and draw 3x columns. Here's one with the tasks from above:

| To Do | In Progress | Done |
|---|---|---|
| Update resume/cv |  |  |
| Update job sites |  |  |
| Find which job "title" is best for me |  |  |
| Send resume and cover letter to recruiters |  |  |

Then as jobs progress then are moved in the kanban columns (with additional entries where relevant)

| To Do | In Progress | Done |
|---|---|---|
|  |  | Update resume/cv |
|  | Update job sites |  |
|  | Choose job to apply for |  |
|  | review tech writer jobs |  |
| review article writer jobs |  |  |
| Send resume and cover letter to recruiters |  |  |

You may choose to do this online, especially since most job ads are there. In this case I'd suggest getting yourself a free *Github*  account and setting up a kanban project

* [Setup kanban project on Github](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/creating-a-project-board) -- remember to choose "basic kanban"

NOTE: There are other companies you can get a free account with for kanban, but they tend to be more complicated.

## Setup on your computer

Honestly, it's surprisingly hard to find a Kanban organizer app for your computer or smartphone.

One workaround would be to use a spreadsheet approach as it's got the columns automatically there.
