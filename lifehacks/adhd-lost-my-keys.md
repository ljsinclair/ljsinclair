# I've lost my [insert thing here] and it's driving me crazy!

## Issue

ARGH! I can't find my stuff and I need it **now**!

It's **so** frustrating, and takes enormous time to find things.

## Solution

There's a measure of self-imposed Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) to this.

I have a little box that I keep by the door. In my case it's a jewellery box, but it could be anything.

When I walk in, I drop keys, cards, money into the box.

When I walk out, I pick them up and go about my day.
