# I've lost my [insert thing here] and it's driving me crazy!

There's a measure of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) to this.

What I do is I have a little box that I **always** put keys and wallet into.

This is placed close to the front door.

And when I walk in, I drop the keys and wallet into that.
