I find email an interminable experience, and difficult to use at the best of times. Threaded conversations don't help, neither does tagging, multiple folders to organise, or anything else for that matter.

However, I've encountered Kanban working in the IT industry and as long as it doesn't get too cluttered, makes seeing the status of different items far easier.

At its simplest you get 3 columns: To-do, In progress, Done.

Ideally the progression is automatic, but in some cases (such as software development), they can also be manual.
My solution for email

First, create 5x folders:

* 01-To-do
* 02-In progress
* 03-On hold
* 04-Complete
* 05-Rejected (which can be skipped because it's the same as Trash)

Note: I'm manually numbering the folders to keep them in the correct order in the tree, plus to show the "column" order.

Second, setup a mail rule to move all incoming mail to "01-To-Do".

From there, when I answer emails, I move them to the appropriate folder when I answer them, review, etc.

## Further thought

* I've hunted for a Kanban client off and on for a couple of years with no success; the ones that work prioritise commercial email services rather than email in general, and the client I found never worked on my machine.
* Ideally there'd be an email client which would be cross-platform compatible (Apple, MS, linux,ChromeOS,Android, etc)
* Ideally the client would group messages in the same way as a helpdesk/support-ticketing system, so there's a clearer relationship between messages and responses.
* I've considered setting up something like Freshdesk to experiment with this but never had the time
* An interesting article on using "Scrum" techniques -- which relate to Kanban -- to manage ADHD
