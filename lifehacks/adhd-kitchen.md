I find kitchens an absolute nightmare. Design aside, cupboards and drawers conceal what's there, which means I don't know what's there without deliberately looking.

Or to put it another way, if I can't see it, it doesn't exist.

## How I get around problems

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| Can't see the food I've got so I buy more | Setup a narrow bookshelf (e.g., IKEA Ivar or Billy) in the kitchen and put food there |
| Fruit and veg goes off or is forgotten | Put fruit in a very prominent position (e.g., dining table), and veg in containers with clear lids (or glass jars) close to front of the fridge |
| Made dinner, got to get up to get cutlery | I now think in terms of a cafe that's got a container for cutlery, and salt/pepper on the table |
| Middle of making dinner, got to walk across the kitchen to find something, get distracted and do something else; food burns, I don't eat | Keep everything for a task right where you need it, and within arms reach. That way it's where you need it **when** you need it. |

## Take-home message

1. Keep things you need for tasks grouped together (e.g., tea/coffee with kettle, cutlery on the table, tools for making food by the cooker)
2. Keep everything visible at all times.
